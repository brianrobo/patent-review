**SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION**

Technical advantages are generally achieved, by embodiments of this disclosure which describe a method and system for fake base station detection [1].

In accordance with an embodiment, a method for detecting fake base stations is provided, as may be performed by a first wireless device such as a base station or a user equipment [1]. In this example, the method includes identifying multiple parameters associated with a discovery signal transmitted by a second wireless device, the second wireless device advertising as a base station controller (BS) [1]. The method further includes comparing the multiple parameters associated with the discovery signal transmitted by the second wireless device with a set of parameters assigned to, or otherwise associated with, a cluster of neighboring BSs [1]. The method further includes determining that the second wireless device is a fake BS when an inconsistency between the parameters associated with the discovery signal transmitted by the second wireless device and the set of parameters assigned to, or otherwise associated with, the cluster of neighboring BSs exceeds a threshold [1]. An apparatus for performing this method is also provided [1].

In accordance with another embodiment, a method for detecting fake base stations is provided, as may be performed by a first wireless device such as a base station or a user equipment [2]. In this example, the method includes detecting a discovery signal of a second wireless device, the second wireless device advertising as a base station controller (BSC) [2]. The method further includes determining a power threshold and a minimum lifetime duration assigned to, or otherwise associated with, a cluster of neighboring BSCs [2]. The method further includes determining that the second wireless device is a faked base station when both a received power level of the discovery signal exceeds the power threshold and a lifetime of the discovery signal fails to exceed the minimum lifetime duration, the lifetime of the discovery signal corresponding to a period of time for which the discovery signal is capable of being detected by the first wireless device [2].
