**ABSTRACT**
A system and method of detecting fake base stations. A first wireless device such as a user equipment (UE) or a base station (BS) may identify multiple parameters associated with a discovery signal transmitted by a second wireless device, the second wireless device advertising as a BS. The first wireless device may compare the multiple parameters with a set of parameters assigned to, or otherwise associated with, a cluster of neighboring BSs, and determine that the second wireless device is a fake BS when an inconsistency between the multiple parameters and the set of parameters associated with the cluster of neighboring BSs exceeds a threshold. The UE or the BS may also transmit the multiple parameters to a central controller, and the central controller may aggregate, correlate, and analyze the parameters, historical data, and other data from other sources associated with the second wireless device to determine whether the second wireless device is a fake BS.
